Coliseum
========

This is a toy project for collective video viewing, tagging and
commenting. The idea is that people will find video on a given subject,
mark it with the tags and comment if they like. By recommending and
tagging, a good list of flicks can be collected and nicely organized.

Todo
----

* Add "like" to save (recommend) a video
* Add "tags" to categorize video
* Show the list of the most recently saved videos with tags, titles,
  thumb and the number of comments
* When searching, show two columns -- local and remote matches;
  Add paginationg to both
* To like, tag or comment, you need to be logged through twitter

Requirements
------------

* Ruby 1.9.3
* MongoDB

Contributing
------------

* Please check the list of planned features above.
* If you want to pick something for implementation, let me know.
* If you have something to say, you are welcome to post an issue or
  leave a comment in the commit. I'm learning thins Ember.js thing,
  and welcome any feedback.
* Submit a pull requests if you implemented anything. I may ask you to
  change a few things, but that should be a familiar thing if you happen
  to contribute on Github before.
