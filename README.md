Coliseum
========

This is a toy project for collective video viewing, tagging and
commenting. The idea is that people will find video on a given subject,
mark it with the tags and comment if they like. By recommending and
tagging, a good list of flicks can be collected and nicely organized.

Features
--------

* Search for video on Youtube
* Commenting (locally, not to Youtube)

Todo
----

* Let people tag video with hashtags in comments (for example, "great
  video on #emberjs")
* Search results pagination.

* Try showing "recent" comments (display video and comments when
  clicked) when the search query is empty. Replace with the remote
  results when it's not.


Requirements
------------

* Ruby 1.9.3
* MongoDB

Contributing
------------

* If you have something to say, you are welcome
